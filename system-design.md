# System Design

## Overview

The ecommerce platform is built as a monolithic Django application with integrated machine learning capabilities. It provides a comprehensive set of APIs for managing products, orders, carts, and user interactions, with built-in ML features for product recommendations and search optimization.

## Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- Monolithic Django 4.2+ application
- Django Ninja Extra for API development
- PostgreSQL for primary database
- Redis for caching and session management
- Celery for background tasks
- S3 for file storage
- Stripe for payment processing

### Machine Learning Integration
- Product recommendation engine
- Search ranking optimization
- Customer segmentation
- Demand forecasting
- Fraud detection
- All ML models are integrated within Django using:
  - PyTorch for model training and inference
  - Celery for asynchronous model predictions
  - Redis for caching predictions
  - PostgreSQL for storing model outputs

## Core Components

### API Layer (Django Ninja Extra)
